Wox.Plugin.WordPressCodex
=====================

Searching WordPress core made easy. Finding results is very fast because it searches in local JSON files (instead of an online API).
The JSON files included in this workflow are created with the [WP Parser JSON plugin](https://github.com/keesiemeijer/wp-parser-json)  

Features
---------
You can search through all this and click to access rapidly on the WordPress reference page :
- ***Actions***: `wp action init`
- ***Classes***: `wp class wp query`
- ***Hooks***: `wp hook get term`
- ***Filters***: `wp filter edit term link`
- ***Functions***: `wp function get permalink`

Installation
---------
To install the plugin :
- Download the latest release of the plugin : https://github.com/DamChtlv/WordPress-Codex-Wox-Plugin/releases/latest/download/WordPress.Codex.zip
- Go to your folder `C:/Users/%USER%/AppData/Roaming/Wox/Plugins` then simply unzip the archive and you should have a folder named **WordPress Codex**  
*Should be something like: `C:/Users/%USER%/AppData/Roaming/Wox/Plugins/WordPress Codex/`*
- Restart **Wox** and type `Settings`
- Verify that you have correctly set the **Python** Path in **General** tab  
*Should be something like: `C:/Users/%user%/AppData/Local/Programs/Python/Python37/`*  
- Go to the **Plugin** tab and look for **WordPress Codex** plugin  
*If it doesn't show, either you put the plugin folder in the wrong directory or Wox can't find your python*
- Type `wp` in **Wox** & wait few secs *(you will see the loading occuring while it's checking / updating json files)*
- Enjoy âœŒ 

Version
-------
*It's all based on **WordPress 5.2 Codex / Developer references***  
**Update** command allows to update json files to get latest version of codex reference.

TODO
----
- Allow random search without prefix: `wp get permalink` *(and maybe add type of reference in description of result)*  
- Improve search algorithm, this should normally works: `wp function get title` *(by exploding each word and search for each of them a match)*
